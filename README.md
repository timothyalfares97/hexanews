- Do not use semicolon at the end of statement or import
- Variable naming should use camelCase style
- Use only let and const in declaring a variable
- Use single quote (') for string import, variable instead of double quote (")
- Always put code into component class when it is reusable
- Do not put a duplicate variable name that can confuse the usage

- Always use braces for all control structures
- Use two spaces for indentation
- Column limit of 120 characters per line
- One statement per line
- Do not add any trailing whitespaces
- Put all function arguments on the same line as the function name. If they exceed the column limit, the arguments must be line-wrapped for readibility
